<br>0x100 X, Y - Spawn Platform
<br>	X = Time in Ticks (Used Values: 0x30, 0x60, 0x90, 0xC0, 0xF0, 0x120, 0x150, 0x180)
<br>	Y = Type of platform
<br>	0 - Kick (Heart Flower)
<br>	1 - Snare (Lollipop)
<br>	2 - Cymbal (Umbrella)
<br>	3 - Kick (Heart Flower, before Umbrella)
<br>	4 - Star (End)
<br>	5 - Edge (End)
<br>
<br>0x101 X - Steps
<br>	0 - Floor (no gaps)
<br>	1 - Steps (w/ gaps)
<br>	2 - Random (either)
<br>
<br>0x102<X> - Camera
<br>	0 - Start

<br>	2 - Set condvar to 1 if camera is playing
<br>
<br>0x103 - Spawn Balloons
<br>0x103<1> X - Pop Specified Balloon, 0~6
<br>Note that the sfx are baked into the music, this command doesn't play them on its own.
<br>
<br>0x104 - If platform "Star (End)" exists, force the End platform to open and make Play-Yan fly away (?) (Unused)
<br>
<br>0x105 - Death Check (Sets condvar to 1 if you fell)
<br>Accompanied with:
<br>if 1
<br>	goto 0x7B
<br>endif
<br>the stuff at label 0x7B basically removes any textboxes on the screen, disables inputs and fades out the music. It's placed near the end of the game, which in a remix setting you most likely won't need
<br>
<br>0x106 - Set condvar to 1 if all the stars are maximum size (Unused)
<br>
<br>0x107 - Set condvar to 1 if platform "Star (End)" exists (Unused)
