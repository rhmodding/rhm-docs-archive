<br>
<br>0x104 X - Ground Length	(Used Values: 0, 9, 0xF)
<br>
<br>0x105 - Bunny flies through the background to the moon
<br>
<br>---------------------
<br>The moon is always spawned at a fixed location matching where it is at the end of the vanilla game, and it scrolls along with the screen
<br>If you need to have the moon at the end at a different time, you'll need to edit the X position of its animations (not sprites) in the bccad file
<br>Below is a formula created by deni_iguess, which assumes the first turtle (beat 0) is at the very start of the game
<br>(keep in mind that the Ground is still counted when it comes to where the moon is, and it is possible the result you get with this is off,
<br>so make sure you take a screenshot of the vanilla placement at the end of Bunny Hop to compare it to fine-tune the exact location)
<br>
<br>187 * [ammount in beats] = X
<br>29160 - X + ([ammount in beats] / 2) - Y = moon location
<br>Y = add 4 every 5 beats
<br>
<br>for example, 40 beats:
<br>187 * 40
<br>29160 - 7480 + (40 / 2) - 32 = 21668
<br>
<br>another example, 6 beats:
<br>187 * 6
<br>29160 - 1122 + (6 / 2) - 4 = 28037
